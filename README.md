# Ludlow University Test Website

## Overview

After reading through the brief and looking at the desktop design on Figma. I decided to use Bootstrap 5 for the frontend because I have used it on the last two commercial projects I've worked on and I am happy with the support it offers for older browsers whilst supporting flexbox, and has built-in responsive classes for mobile devices. I also chose to use Bootstrap icons in this project.

I downloaded the assets from Figma ready to import into React.

I chose not to use the Contensis React Base package as I use it almost daily in my current role when working on projects, and I also wanted to keep this package as lightweight as possible and give me the option to demonstrate my abilities using React without relying on the features provided in the base package.

## Plugins Used

- Sass
- React Router
- use-react-router-breadcrumb

I used Sass for custom css, and React Router for routing pages as I've used this previously on small test projects whilst learning React.

I used use-react-router-breadcrumb in order to add a small working breadcrumb.

## Simulating Content

Instead of having all of my written content inline, I opted to simulate connecting to a service by creating JSON objects.

## Browser Testing

I manually tested this project on multiple browsers and to simulate mobile devices I used the respective developer tools in Safari and Chrome.

I tested the site in the Chromium based version of Microsoft Edge.

## Accessibility

I spend a lot of time in my current role dealing with accessibility for our websites.

I checked the website with Axe Dev Tools as we recently were audited by the Home Office for accessibility and this is the tool they use to check sites with.

## Things I'm not happy with

I use styled-components extensively in my current role and I would have preferred to use styled-components in this project, but I had issues with styled components causing errors and due to time constraints I chose to use .scss files instead.

## If I rebuilt this a year from now

### Imagery

I would have liked to have converted the source images to .webp

### Testing

I see testing as the next stage as I continue to work in React. Cypress and the React Testing Library are two resources that I intend to use on my next project.

### BEM

I am aware of BEM, and I see its advantages, especially when working in a team, I want to make more use of BEM in the future.
